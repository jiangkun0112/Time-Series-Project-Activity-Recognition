# Time-Series-Project-Activity-Recognition

The project focuses on the analysis and prediction of acitivities of user's movement using the data collected from a wearable accelerometer mounted on the chest. In this project, we are analyzing accelerometer data trying to answer the following questions:

a) Analyze and derive input features to find the difference in the accelerometer data from different activities.

b) Utilize accelerometer data to predict the type of activity
